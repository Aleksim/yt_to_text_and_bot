 What's your exercise routine just to linger on that? How much you curl? What are we talking about here? That's all I do at the gym side. My routine, on a good day, I do about half an hour of cardio and I do about 45 minutes of weight lifting, resistance, training of some kind. Mostly weights. I have a trainer who I love, who pushes me, which is really helpful. I'll be like, he'll say, Jeff, can we go up on that weight a little bit and I'll think about it and I'll be like, no, I don't think so. He'll look at me and say, yeah, I think you can. But of course, he's right. Of course. It's always cool to have somebody push you a little bit. Almost every day. You do that. Almost every day, I do a little bit of cardio and a little bit of weight lifting and I wrote to you, I do a pulling day and a pushing day and a leg day. It's all pretty standard stuff.
